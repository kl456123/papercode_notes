assumption:
    use channel attention to noise
    lower layer is unable to exploit contexual information outside of this region


SE building block:
    sequeeze:
    global information embedding
    use global average pooling to generate channel-wise statistic


    excitation:
    adaptive recalibration
    model which aims to fully capture channel-wise dependencies
    gating mechanism with a sigmoid activation

    formulation:
    s = F_ex(z,W) = sigmoid(W2*relu(W1*z))

    W2 and W1 to form a bottleneck to limit model complexity and\
    aid generalisation

    output = F_scale(u_c,s_c) = s_c*u_c
    scale in channel-wise

Note:
    In later layers SE blocks becomes increasingly specialised , and responds
    to different inputs in a highly class-specific manner
