# key point

ARM(anchor refine module) and ODM(object detection module)


propose of ARM :
    1. remove negaive anchors so as to reduce search space
    2. coarsely adjust the locations and sizes of anchors


propose of ODM :
    1. regress accurate object locations and predict multi-class labels
    based on the refined anchors


three core components :
    1. transfer connection block(TCB)
    2. two-step cascaded regression
    3. negative anchor filtering, early rejecting well-classified negative anchors
    and mitigate the imbalance issue

feature of TCB :
    1. convert features of different layers from the ARM , into the form required by the ODM
    2. integrate large-scale context by adding the high level features(Top-down addition)

Two-Step Cascaded Regression

Negative Anchor Filtering

Anchors Design and Matching

Hard Negative Mining :
    select some nagetive anchor boxes with top loss values to make the ratio between the negatives
    and positives below 3:1(like SSD)
