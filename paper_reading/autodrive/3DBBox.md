# main
1. 3D object orientation using a novel hybrid discrete-continuous loss(better than L2 Loss)
2. regress the 3D object dimensions
3. these estimates combined with th egeometric constraints on translation imposed by the 2D bounding box
to recover a stable and accurate 3D object pose




# others
viewpoint estimate
pose estimate




1. MultiBin Orientation Estimation
* global oejct orientation = local orientation+\theta_ray
* multibin to estimate orientation(classification and regression)
* L2 loss for dimension


note that regression of dimensions is better than parameters related to translation
