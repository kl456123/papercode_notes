calculate bbox(x,y,w,h) from predictions(t_x,t_y,t_w,t_h) of convolution

b_x = (f(t_x)+c_x)/w
b_y = (f(t_y)+c_y)/h
b_w = p_w*exp(t_w)/w
b_h = p_h*exp(t_h)/h

where p_h and p_w are just anchors




Region layer of darknet
some statics valuable:

avg_iou: just for fg
recall: iou>0.5
avg_cat
avg_obj: avg of objectness prior for fg
avg_anyobj: avg of objectness prior for any bbox
rescore: using iou to replace objectness gt
1. activate predict using logistic function

loss function of yolo


# forward

two loops ,one for predictions ,the other for groundtruth

1. loop for predictions
find gt_box that is the best matched with bbox
calculate the objectness of bbox
(note that in the begining force all box match with standard anchors,
it may be better for converage)

2. loop for gt

determinate if it is fg or bg using iou according to bias_match
if it is fg ,objectness should be forecd to 1, otherwise it should be 0.

for fg:
    objectness is 1(or iou if rescore)
    classes: classes_gt
    bbox: bbox_gt

for bg
    objectness is 0


# backward
all is least square loss
so get the delta of gt and pred

loss = ||delta||^2
grad = delta

for t_x and t_y
grad = delta*logistic'(x)
